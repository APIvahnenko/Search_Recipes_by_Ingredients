content:-
The smell of cheese in many decent restaurants in France is what differentiates them from similar restaurants in the UK.

Radicchio, chestnut and blue cheese salad
content:-
Bitter leaves, salty cheese, sweet chestnuts: this is a winter salad that I can’t confine myself to eating just in season. I generally go for Gorgonzola or Stilton here, but essentially what you need is blue cheese that will crumble well without going into buttery clumps. And while I would never normally condone putting either in the fridge, here the cheese must be cold so that you can crumble it.

Prawn croquetas
content:-
Port-Vendres, which is between Collioure and Banyuls in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, used to be a thriving fishing port but sadly, due to overfishing, there’s now only one full-time trawler working there. The poissonnerie across the harbour still manages to stock a magnificent selection by buying from boats fishing in the Atlantic. The seafood bar there sells things like grilled sardines, squid, fruits de mer and a few Catalan specialties, including prawn croquetas.

Deep-fried coconut prawns
content:-
If you have been anywhere by the sea in the Yucatan peninsula you will have had these deep-fried king prawns with a coconut batter. Curiously to me, they often come with an apple sauce, but less frequently they’re served with a papaya and habanero dipping sauce, which I like. The other problem is the batter is often too sweet, so this is my version with no sugar.

Boeuf bourguignon
content:-
It’s worth getting good-quality, well-marbled meat from the butcher’s shop for this dish. The supermarket meat is often too lean and will become dry rather than succulent during the long cooking.

When we were filming in Greece, stuffed vegetables was our favourite dish. It all stemmed from a brief lunch stop at the little fishing village of Astakos, where we asked what was for lunch at the first quayside café we came to. They said stuffed tomatoes and peppers, which had just come out of the oven. Straight from the oven when you are ravenously hungry is perfect.

Butternut and sweet potato curry
content:-
This is a rambunctiously vibrant vegan curry, both to look at and eat. It is rich, sweet and hearty, with tomatoes providing a balancing acidity and the curry paste bringing uncompromising fire. Of course chillies do vary in heat, so if you’re after something a little less passage-clearing, use two rather than three, and if you want to go milder still, simply de-seed the chillies. Having said that, cooking with chillies always has a touch of roulette about it.
